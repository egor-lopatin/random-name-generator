# Random Name Generator

This is a simple random name generator that generates random names based on pre-defined syllables. The name is generated by combining a random syllable, adjective and animal.

The motivation behind this project is to create a simple and fun program that generates random names for various purposes, such as naming a project, a repository, a server, a device, etc. with command line interface.

## Command line arguments

The program accepts the following command line arguments:
- `-l` lowercase the generated name
- `-u` uppercase the generated name
- `-c` capitalize the generated name
- `-x` Unix style output (spaces are replaced with underscores)
- `-h` print help message

## Build and install

Makefile is provided for easy compilation, install and uninstall. To compile the program, run `make`, to install the program, run `make install` and to uninstall the program, run `make uninstall`.

It is designed to be installed locally in the user's home directory `~/.local/bin`, so make sure that `~/.local/bin` is in your `PATH` environment variable.
Put the following in your `.bashrc`, `.bash_profile`, or `.zprofile` file:

```shell
if [ -d "$HOME/.local/bin" ]; then
    export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
fi
```

## Usage

To generate a random name, simply run the program without any arguments:

```shell
$ random-name-generator
```

To generate a random name with a specific style, use the command line arguments or their combination:

```shell
$ random-name-generator -lx
```

Mkdir in unix-shell:
```shell
$ mkdir $(random-name-generator -lx)
or
$ random-name-generator | xargs mkdir
```
